# Tech Wars :punch:

A clash between multiple backend technos to see who comes out victorious, with a Vue.js front.
Stats will include REST controller response time, ORM mapping time, DB connector reponse time, etc...

## Live App

Of course this will have to be live!

## Frontent

Vue.js App that calls a given number of REST endpoints then determines the basic stats by backend technology .
Looking into implementing Jmetter/Gatling type frameworks for load testing aswell.

## Backends

- Node.js
  - Express + pg connector
  - Loopback
- dotnet core
  - pg connector
  - Entity Framework Core
- Springboot
  - Spring data
- ...
